        "AboutText": "My last place of work was WAVES company, I worked there as a Middle+ Frontend Developer. My role was to create a new website functionality and support it, and I also did a code review of my colleagues. Initially I was working on a swop.fi project on the WAVES blockchain. The turnover of the project was $ 10 million and more than 100,000 users, who accounted for 25% of all transactions on the blockchain. After a year of work, it was decided to create a new project axly.io so for the last six months I have been working on 2 projects in parallel. axly.io launched in August 2023. Unfortunately, the current crisis is very difficult for the WAVES blockchain and a lot of teams have been disbanded, including mine.",
